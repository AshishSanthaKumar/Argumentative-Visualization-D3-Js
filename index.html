    <h4><u>Who is the G.O.A.T ?</u></h4> 
    Now, this is a billion-dollar question. The entire football community is divided on this one question. We are going to visually analyze this and try to arrive at a solution. The data for this analysis was extracted from <a href="https://michelacosta.com/en/messi-vs-cristiano-achievements-golden-ball/" target="_blank">Michelacosta.com</a><br><br>

    <b>Left Chart</b><br>
    This is a Cleveland dot plot that represents the goals scored by both Messi and Ronaldo in different leagues including their All-time Career goals. It is clear from the plot that Ronaldo (Green Dot) is ahead of Messi(Purple Dot) in
    almost every segment. The difference in goals is less significant in their club representation, La Liga, and Champions League. But we can see a huge lead when it comes to All-time career and International goals.
    <b>Clearly, Ronaldo has won this battle.</b><br><br>
    <b>Right Chart</b><br>
    This is a visual representation of the number of Awards (Ballon d'Or and Golden Shoe) each person has under their name. We can clearly see that Messi has more awards in his cabinet than Cristiano Ronaldo. There is also a year label
    which shows the year they were awarded. The Ballon d'Or's are represented by the design of an actual Ballon d'Or. This goes with the European Golden Shoe too. <b>Messi has won this battle.</b><br><br>
    <b>Rhetorical devices used:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Omission (Few leagues and Awards were omitted)</li>
        <li>Simplification (Using images instead a chart for the Trophy Cabinet)</li>
        <li>Anchoring (Using Small smileys next to the name to indicate the winner)</li>
        <li>Comparison (The Goal point on the left chart lie on the same horizontal line)</li>
        <li>Cultural Codes (The Sad smiley for the loser of the Chart)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Personal Opinion</b><br>
    I personally think Messi is the G.O.A.T because I feel he is a more complete player. Being a great Football player is not just about scoring goals. When it comes to assists, passing, and dribbling skills, Messi is definitely ahead.
    There is also the factor of the number of matches played by each of them (Messi has played a lesser number of matches). But this will always be one of the greatest battles of our times.
